I'm a first year undergraduate student from [faculty of mathematics](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/). Because of limited knowledge, I haven't found my research interest. This blog aims to document my experience and thought in my journey of learning mathematics.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

Why I want to make a personal homepage?

Professor [Hao Sun](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2018/0316/c14638a440127/page.htm) who taught me geometry in first semester influcend me, as well as I have been motivated by some outstanding homepage. Here I tend to share several homepages that impress me.
